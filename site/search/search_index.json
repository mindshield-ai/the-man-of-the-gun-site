After discovering the existence of the SCN, he embarks on a journey that forces him to confront not only the forces manipulating reality but also the darkness within himself. His body and mind are corrupted, gradually transformed into a software-like entity, constantly fighting the SCN\u2019s influence. Shiniza Yakavaze A deformed, elderly Japanese man confined to a wheelchair, Shiniza Yakavaze is a powerful antagonist deeply intertwined with the SCN. Though physically crippled, his mastery of the network allows him to manipulate reality itself. His deteriorated body is a reflection of the price paid for his manipulation of the SCN. His pistol-wielding arm makes him a formidable foe despite his frailty. Kettleback Kettleback is a strange and unsettling boss character who hobbles about while carrying a boiling kettle. His twisted spine and sluggish movements conceal a mind sharp enough to manipulate the SCN. He has survived numerous battles against forces unseen, but every victory has left a physical mark, symbolizing the cost of his power. His calm demeanor, despite his grotesque appearance, makes him a sinister figure. Ashkaboos Ashkaboos is a shadowy antagonist who serves the Dining Philosophers. Though powerful, he is merely a puppet for the Philosophers, tasked with enforcing their will across the SCN. Ashkaboos\u2019s body is as corrupted as his mind, distorted by years of manipulating the SCN. His presence is both terrifying and tragic as he struggles with his role as an enforcer of the Philosophers' agenda. Seamus O'Driscoll Seamus O'Driscoll is an old Irish mentor who guides Clayton through the treacherous reality of the SCN. Once a powerful manipulator of the network, Seamus is now weary and broken, having seen the toll the SCN takes on those who use it. His wisdom is invaluable, but his melancholy and fatigue suggest that he has little time left to guide Clayton. The Dining Philosophers (History) The Dining Philosophers are the hidden rulers of the SCN, an enigmatic group that manipulates the very fabric of human thought and emotion through the network. They have existed for centuries, slowly influencing society, sowing confusion and conflict, all to maintain their grip on power. Their history is filled with acts of manipulation, betrayal, and ruthless control, all in the name of order and stability. Their power comes at the cost of those who dare to oppose them, leaving a trail of corruption and devastation in their wake.","title":"Characters"},{"location":"about/characters/#clayton-harrow","text":"(coming soon) Clayton Harrow is a disillusioned, middle-aged bureaucrat trapped in a life devoid of purpose.

Burdened by a life of routine and disillusionment, Clayton drifts through his existence, numb to purpose, culture, and human connection. But his awakening comes when he inadvertently stumbles upon a secret, hidden layer of reality known as the Soul Communication Network (SCN). The SCN is not a construct of human technology or imagination; it is an ancient, metaphysical web beyond the radio spectrum, unseen and unheard, yet integral to life as we know it. This network has existed since the dawn of humanity, influencing thoughts, emotions, and the very fabric of existence. Over time, beings both human and beyond have attempted to harness the power of the SCN, often to catastrophic effect. Clayton's journey begins when he realizes his body, though biological, operates like a complex digital system. The SCN (Soul Communication Network) connects and influences biological systems remotely, much like wireless signals affect software. Diseases in this world aren't just physical ailments; they resemble software malfunctions\u2014errors that can disrupt the body's processes. Remote Cell Synchrony Modification (RCSM) represents the most dangerous manipulation, able to alter human biology and perception through the SCN, distorting both body and mind from a distance. As the glitches in Clayton\u2019s body and mind worsen, he encounters horrifying entities\u2014clones of himself, twisted and broken, driven by a primal envy born from their incompleteness. They are the embodiment of \"Invy\", the ancient form of envy that corrodes both soul and body. Throughout his journey, Seamus O\u2019Driscoll, an old Irish mentor with a deep, sorrowful understanding of the SCN, guides Clayton. Seamus, weary from his own battles with the network, imparts vital wisdom but knows his time is running out. The deeper Clayton delves into the SCN\u2019s mysteries, the more he understands the price of power. Those who manipulate the SCN, like the game\u2019s bosses, are left deformed, both physically and mentally. One such figure is Shiniza Yakavaze, an elderly, deformed Japanese man confined to a wheelchair, whose powerful connection to the SCN has twisted his body beyond recognition. Though physically broken, Shiniza wields a power that can alter reality itself, forcing Clayton to question what is real. Ultimately, Clayton must decide: continue serving as a cog in the network, manipulated by unseen forces, or break free and risk tearing apart the very fabric of the SCN, even if it means losing his humanity entirely. Prologue: Echoes of the Unseen In a world much like our own, where technology and routine dictate the flow of daily life, there exists a hidden layer of reality known only to a select few. This layer, the Soul Communication Network (SCN), is an ancient, metaphysical web that influences thoughts, emotions, and the very essence of existence. Unbeknownst to the masses, the SCN has been both a source of enlightenment and a tool for manipulation throughout human history. In the sprawling metropolis of New Elysium, technology and routine dictate the flow of life. Advanced AI systems, operating from unseen servers and backends, manage the city's infrastructure with unparalleled efficiency. Humans are relegated to mundane tasks that seem purposeless, serving roles that could easily be automated. Amidst this backdrop, Clayton Harrow, a \"Deal Architect\" at Nexum Enterprises, navigates a life steeped in monotony and unfulfilled potential. His days are a blur of paperwork and meaningless interactions, his nights filled with restless sleep and vague dissatisfaction.","title":"Story"},{"location":"about/story/#intro-to-the-story-of-the-man-of-the-gun","text":"Clayton Harrow, a once mundane bureaucrat, begins his descent into a chaotic, unpredictable world\u2014a world woven with threads that transcend human understanding.
