<p>Clayton Harrow, a once mundane bureaucrat, begins his descent into a chaotic, unpredictable world—a world woven with threads that transcend human understanding. Burdened by a life of routine and disillusionment, Clayton drifts through his existence, numb to purpose, culture, and human connection. But his awakening comes when he inadvertently stumbles upon a secret, hidden layer of reality known as the Soul Communication Network (SCN).</p>
<p>The SCN is not a construct of human technology or imagination; it is an ancient, metaphysical web beyond the radio spectrum, unseen and unheard, yet integral to life as we know it. This network has existed since the dawn of humanity, influencing thoughts, emotions, and the very fabric of existence. Over time, beings both human and beyond have attempted to harness the power of the SCN, often to catastrophic effect.</p>
<p>Clayton's journey begins when he discovers his body is no longer simply biological; it is a program, prone to glitches and corruption. Diseases like cancer in this world are not merely physical ailments, but software malfunctions—glitches that can be transmitted through the SCN. The most insidious of these corruptions is known as Remote Cell Synchrony Modification (RCSM), a weaponized form of manipulation designed to distort human bodies and minds through the network.</p>
<p>But Clayton is more than just a man; his body and soul are interconnected to the SCN in ways even he doesn't fully understand. This connection draws the attention of The Dining Philosophers, an enigmatic group of overseers who manipulate the SCN to control human emotion, sow confusion, and control society at its deepest levels. Ashkaboos, one of the primary antagonists, serves as their puppet—wielding immense control over the SCN, yet trapped as a servant to their power. As Clayton's awareness grows, he must grapple with the realization that death is not an end but a feature in this world—a way to cleanse and reboot the system. But every death comes at a cost: a piece of him erodes with each self-destruction.</p>
<p>As the glitches in Clayton’s body and mind worsen, he encounters horrifying entities—clones of himself, twisted and broken, driven by a primal envy born from their incompleteness. They are the embodiment of "Invy", the ancient form of envy that corrodes both soul and body.</p>
<p>Throughout his journey, Seamus O’Driscoll, an old Irish mentor with a deep, sorrowful understanding of the SCN, guides Clayton. Seamus, weary from his own battles with the network, imparts vital wisdom but knows his time is running out.</p>
<p>The deeper Clayton delves into the SCN’s mysteries, the more he understands the price of power. Those who manipulate the SCN, like the game’s bosses, are left deformed, both physically and mentally. One such figure is Shiniza Yakavaze, an elderly, deformed Japanese man confined to a wheelchair, whose powerful connection to the SCN has twisted his body beyond recognition. Though physically broken, Shiniza wields a power that can alter reality itself, forcing Clayton to question what is real.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Clayton must decide: continue serving as a cog in the network, manipulated by unseen forces, or break free and risk tearing apart the very fabric of the SCN, even if it means losing his humanity entirely.</p></p>
