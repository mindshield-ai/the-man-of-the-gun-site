Haunted by his past and uncertain about his future, Clayton is thrust into a brutal struggle with the Soul Communication Network.</p> <p></p> <p>Ashkaboos Ashkaboos is not a tyrant, not a dictator, nor a madman seeking control for personal gain. He sees himself as a living martyr, a necessary force in a world doomed to destruction by humanity\u2019s own desires. His role in the Soul Communication Network (SCN) is not one of choice, but of duty. He carries the weight of responsibility, knowing that without the SCN, humanity would descend into chaos.</p> <p>In Ashkaboos\u2019s eyes, the SCN is not a curse, but a refining process\u2014one that strengthens the strong and purges the weak. He doesn\u2019t seek power; he believes he has none. He is merely the caretaker, a servant of the Dining Philosophers, bound to protect the fragile system that holds reality together.</p> <p>Though calm and authoritative, Ashkaboos is not without weariness. Every action he takes, every life he manipulates, weighs heavily on him. He is not without compassion\u2014he simply believes that without his intervention, the world would destroy itself. His vision of control is not about domination; it\u2019s about survival. As he often says, \u201cThis is not cruelty. It is mercy.\u201d</p> <p>The SCN was broken long before Ashkaboos came to it. He sees himself as the only one capable of holding it together, even if it means being seen as the villain. He doesn't relish the title, but he accepts it as the price for keeping humanity from tearing itself apart. Ashkaboos\u2019s ultimate goal is not control or power, but balance\u2014a balance that he alone can provide through the SCN.</p> <p></p> <p>Seamus O'Driscoll Seamus O'Driscoll is a weary, broken man who once walked in the light but now lives in the shadows of regret. His wisdom comes at a great cost, both to his body and his soul. Once a vibrant figure, Seamus has been worn down by years of exposure to the Soul Communication Network (SCN), the invisible web that connects all living beings on a level far deeper than technology. Now, he spends his final days in a crumbling cabin on the edge of a dying city, clinging to the faint warmth of a fire and a half-empty glass of whiskey.</p> <p>Seamus\u2019s relationship with the SCN is complicated\u2014both a curse and a gift. He knows its depths better than anyone, having touched its core and seen what it can do to those who delve too deeply. The SCN has taken pieces of him, leaving him frail and haunted by the loss of countless souls he\u2019s witnessed crumble under its weight. Yet, Seamus understands that it is also a powerful tool, one that, if used wisely, can offer salvation. His mentorship of Clayton Harrow is driven by this dual understanding: to warn him of the SCN's dangers while encouraging him to harness its potential.</p> <p>With a thick Irish accent and a voice heavy with sorrow, Seamus speaks as if every word could be his last. His teachings are filled with allegory, often referencing ancient wisdom passed down from the \"old ones,\" who once spoke of the SCN in hushed tones as if it were folklore. But Seamus knows better\u2014it\u2019s no myth. It\u2019s real, and it\u2019s deadly.</p> <p>Despite his somber demeanor, there\u2019s a deep affection between Seamus and Clayton. Seamus does not want to see the same fate befall his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 that claimed so many before him. His plea to Clayton is simple but heartfelt: \u201cUse it wisely, lad. The SCN is the power to change, but also the power to destroy.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"about/story/","title":"The Story of The Man of the Gun","text":"<p>In a world where technology has seeped into the very fabric of human existence, Clayton Harrow finds himself at the crossroads of chaos and order.
